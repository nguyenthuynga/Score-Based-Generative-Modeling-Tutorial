# Score-Based-Generative-Modeling-Tutorial

This repository contains a tutorial on score-based generative modeling, with simple mathematical explanations to aid understanding. The tutorial is based on [this Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/120kYYBOVa1i0TD85RjlEkFjaWDxSFUx3?usp=sharing#scrollTo=XCR6m0HjWGVV) and the foundational concepts are derived from the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13456) by Yang Song et al.

Our toy results can be found in [these slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17FPQBpMr0WZXneJ0suz6WcTht1VMG8fFqCq-VZ5AHwI/edit?usp=sharing) 

## Overview

Score-based generative models, also known as diffusion models, are a powerful class of generative models that have shown state-of-the-art performance in generating high-quality images. This tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to these models, including:

- An intuitive explanation of the underlying concepts.
- A mathematical walkthrough of score-based generative models.
- Step-by-step implementation details.


## Mathematical Background

The tutorial includes a detailed mathematical explanation of the core concepts, such as:

- **Score Matching:** Understanding the score function and its role in guiding the diffusion process.
- **Diffusion Process:** An overview of how the diffusion process is used to generate data samples.
- **Stochastic Differential Equations:** The role of SDEs in modeling the diffusion process.

These explanations are designed to provide a solid foundation for understanding how score-based models work.

## Implementation

The Colab notebook covers the implementation of score-based generative models, with the following features:

- **Data Preparation:** How to preprocess and prepare data for modeling.
- **Model Architecture:** An explanation of the model's architecture and its components.
- **Training Procedure:** Details on the training loop, loss functions, and optimization strategies.
